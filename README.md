# PsychTech Smartwatch Local Helper Version 1.0
This is a program used to fetch data recorded by PsychTech smartwatches from its server. Afterwards, it can display recorded data and features of last experiment.  
## How to use?
1. Make sure the phone-like assistant and the smartphone are connected through Bluetooth. (Sometimes you may need to forget the device in the Bluetooth setting and re-connect again.)
2. Wear the smartphone tightly.
3. Run main.py on your desktop.
4. Hit "开始采集" on the assistant to start data collection.
5. When you want to stop the data collection, press Ctrl + C on your desktop to terminate the program.
6. The data is by default saved to the "/data" folder and you could run dataDisplay.py to check the data of last experiment.
